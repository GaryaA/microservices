# Section 2: Building microservices using Spring Boot

This section covers the creation of basic microservices using Spring Boot. It includes three separate microservices:

*   **accounts**: Manages customer account information.
*   **loans**: Manages loan information.
*   **cards**: Manages card information.

Each microservice is a standalone Spring Boot application with its own RESTful API for CRUD operations, demonstrating the fundamental principles of building microservices.
